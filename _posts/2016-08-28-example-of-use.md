# Example of use

## 1....2.....3 is that easy

Just say : " Hey AIAI I want to plan a business trip to London"

AIAI : "When are you planning to go?"

Me : "I need to be there monday morning and I plan to stay until thursday afternoon"

AIAI : " I've found a direct flight for 430 $ at 6:40 monday morning. You will reach there at 8:20\. The return flight is at 20:45 on thrusday evening. I've found 3 nights at Hilton will cost 420 $. You can also pick a car from the airport with AVIS that will be 45 $ a day. Should I book all of this for you?

Me : "Yes perfect. Can you use the business account for all this?"

AIAI : "All done! All the expenses have been put in you business account. I've put everything in your calendar. Can I help you with anything else?"

Me : "That is all. Thank you"
